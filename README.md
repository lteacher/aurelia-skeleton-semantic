# Simple Aurelia Skeleton with Semantic UI

This is just a template for some Aurelia app with Semantic UI included and bare
bones other stuff. The start kits are loaded to the hilt with great stuff but
are not so simple to start out with or if you want a leaner starter and implement the rest.

Includes async / await support.

## Install / Usage

It is assumed you have `npm` installed

You need to have `jspm` and `gulp` installed globally so if you don't you can run:

```sh
npm install -g jspm gulp
```

Run `npm install` and then run `jspm install`

Serve the app with `gulp serve`
